# Sample Analysis of mMIG Optimization
## Optimization rules in mMIG
> In graph-based logic networks, the transformation rules are decisive in determining the extent of achieved optimization. The rules can take multiple forms for the same
  graph topology. Selection of desirable transformation is done on the basis of which transformation leads to lesser resource count.

There are four permutable pairs for Majority and Minority logic possible shown in the figure below,

Upon considering the reconvergent and nonreconvergent boolean variable, there are 12 basic topologies shown in the figure below,
